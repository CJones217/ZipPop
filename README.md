# First Screen:

Right as the user opens the ZipPop app the user is presented with an an animation of the ZipPop logo. Thereafter if not logged in there could be a screen dedicated to login in the center of the application. There could also be a preview of the games in the background detailing each game that is presented when the user is logged in.

# Game Screen:

Has the box logo at the top center. Underneath that would be a play button to access the game. Below that would be a description of the game.

# Home Screen:

At the top of the screen we can have horizontal scrollable tabs of game genres. Moreover, under those tabs we can have all the games in with a game with the box cover. At the bottom of the screen we can have icons consisting of a home icon, search, membership, and settings.

# Search Screen:

This screen has a search bar at the top waiting for the user to enter something. As a user begins to search the application begins to pop up with games.
